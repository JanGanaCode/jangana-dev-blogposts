[AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk) enables you to define your infrastructure with code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

<Video id="XLkVZIS1nyg" />

<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
Before we dive into creating a React app, make sure you have the following tools
and knowledge:

1. [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.
2. [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk).
3. Basic understanding of JavaScript and React concepts.

<h2>Step 1: Setting Up Your Project Directory</h2>

Start by creating a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir <your_branch_name>
cd <your_branch_name>
```

<h2>Step 2: Create a React App</h2>

```bash
npx create-react-app <your_app_name> --template typescript
```

<h2>Step 3: Create CDK code folder</h2>

```bash
mkdir <your_cdk_infra_code_folder_name>
cd <your_cdk_infra_code_folder_name>
```

<h2>Step 4: Initialize a new CDK app</h2>

```bash
cdk init app --language typescript
```

<h2>Step 5: Create Amplify stack</h2>

Within the **infra/lib** folder create a new file called **amplify-stack.ts**.
Here's a starting code:

```js
import { Stack, StackProps, SecretValue } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { BuildSpec } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-codebuild";
import { App, GitHubSourceCodeProvider } from "@aws-cdk/aws-amplify-alpha";

export class AmplifyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
  }
}
```

<h2>Step 6: Working on a build spec</h2>

```js
import { Stack, StackProps, SecretValue } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { BuildSpec } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-codebuild";
import { App, GitHubSourceCodeProvider } from "@aws-cdk/aws-amplify-alpha";

export class AmplifyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const amplifyAppName = "My React app";

    const amplifyApp = new App(this, amplifyAppName, {
      environmentVariables: {
        AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT:
          "<your_branch_name>/<your_cdk_infra_code_folder_name>",
      },
      sourceCodeProvider: new GitHubSourceCodeProvider({
        owner: "<your_github_username>",
        repository: "<your_repository_name>",
        oauthToken: SecretValue.secretsManager("your_github_token"),
      }),
      buildSpec: BuildSpec.fromObjectToYaml({
        version: "1.0",
        applications: [
          {
            frontend: {
              phases: {
                preBuild: {
                  commands: ["npm ci"],
                },
                build: {
                  commands: ["npm run build"],
                },
              },
              artifacts: {
                baseDirectory: "build",
                files: ["**/*"],
              },
              cache: {
                paths: ["node_modules/**/*"],
              },
            },
            appRoot: "<your_branch_name>/<your_cdk_infra_code_folder_name>",
          },
        ],
      }),
    });
    const mainBranch = amplifyApp.addBranch("<your_branch_name>");
  }
}
```

**Imports**: These imports provide the necessary classes and constructs to define AWS resources.

1. **Stack** and **StackProps** are classes used for defining AWS CloudFormation stacks.
2. **Construct** is a base class for constructing AWS CDK constructs.
3. **BuildSpec** is used for defining build specifications for CodeBuild.
4. **App** and **GitHubSourceCodeProvider** are classes from the AWS Amplify library for configuring Amplify applications and specifying the source code provider (in this case, GitHub).

**AmplifyStack** Class: This code defines a class called AmplifyStack that extends the Stack class, representing an AWS CloudFormation stack.
The AmplifyStack class takes in parameters like scope, id, and optional props, which are used to create an AWS CloudFormation stack.

**Amplify Application Configuration**: Inside the constructor, an Amplify application is configured using the **App** class.
It defines the name of the Amplify application as **"My React app"** and creates an instance of the **App** class to configure it.

**Environment Variables**: Environment variables for the Amplify application are specified.
This sets an environment variable named **AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT** to **"your_branch_name/your_cdk_infra_code_folder_name"** within the Amplify application.

**Source Code Provider**: The code defines the source code provider for the Amplify application, which is GitHub in this case.
It specifies the GitHub repository's owner, repository name, and an OAuth token (which should be stored securely, potentially in AWS Secrets Manager).

**Build Specification**: The build specifications for the Amplify application are defined.
The build specification contains instructions for building the application. It specifies the pre-build and build commands, artifacts, and cache settings.

**Branch Configuration**: Finally, a branch named "react-aws-deployment" is added to the Amplify application.
This code creates a branch within the Amplify application, which can be used to deploy different versions of the application.

<h2>Step 7: Deploy</h2>

```bash
cdk deploy
```
