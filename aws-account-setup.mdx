[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing a wide range of cloud computing services. AWS offers a comprehensive suite of infrastructure and application services that enable organizations to build, deploy, and manage various types of applications and workloads in the cloud.

In this video we'll learn how to create a new AWS account. We'll create a root user and after that we'll create an IAM user.
We'll also learn how to assign MFA for our users and how to give them permissions and access keys so they can interact with AWS services.

You can take advantage of [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free).

The 12 Month Free Tier is only available to new AWS
customers, and is available for 12 months following your AWS
sign-up date.

Not all AWS services are covered under Free Tier.
Some services launched under the Free Tier have usage limits.
If you exceed the usage limits, then you are charged at standard rates.

During the sign-up process your card will be charged 1.00 USD
to verify that the card is valid.
AWS doesnâ€™t proceed with the charge, and the charge
usually disappears within three to five business days.
